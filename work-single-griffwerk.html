              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Context</h2>
              <p>Griffwerk, a German company known for producing high-quality door handles, is expanding its product
                line to include a digital solution for managing digital locks and keys.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Opportunity statement</h2>
              <p>Griffwerk has identified a significant opportunity to expand its product line by introducing a digital
                solution for managing digital locks and keys.
                By developing a digital solution that seamlessly integrates with physical door handles and locks, while
                also being secure and resistant to unauthorized access, Griffwerk can provide a highly desirable product
                to consumers seeking convenient and secure ways to manage access to their homes or businesses.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Challenge</h2>
              <p>Digital solutions are becoming a trend, but what is the most common problem with traditional door lock
                systems?<br> One of the most common problems with traditional door lock systems is the inconvenience of
                managing physical keys. Keys can be lost or stolen, and managing access for multiple individuals can be
                time-consuming and prone to errors.</p>
              <p>Additionally, traditional locks provide limited visibility and control over access, making it difficult
                to track who has entered or left a space and when. This can be especially problematic in situations
                where security is a top priority, such as in commercial or industrial settings.</p>
              <p>How might one give people a seamless and convenient door unlocking experience while ensuring the
                security of their homes and properties?</p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">My role</h2>
              <p>As a Product Designer at Griffwerk, I worked on the Smart2Lock project from February to December 2019,
                collaborating with a Prototyper, a UI designer, and the development team. My responsibilities included
                leading the design process from start to finish, encompassing research, interaction design, visual
                design, and copywriting. Additionally, I worked closely with the marketing team to ensure a cohesive
                user experience.<br> Although my involvement ended before the development phase, I am proud to share
                that the app launched globally on September 15th, 2022.</p>
              <div>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Discovery</h2>
                <p>The primary segment that could benefit from Griffwerk's digital solution, are people who frequently
                  have visitors or guests, such as Airbnb hosts, as well as property managers who need to grant access
                  to multiple individuals for various purposes or manage access to their premises, such as offices,
                  warehouses, and retail stores.
                  These are likely the people to value convenience, security, and efficiency.</p>
                <div>
                  <p><strong>During the research phase, we performed the following activities:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>In-depth interviews:</strong> We conducted 1:1 interviews with Airbnb hosts, property
                      managers, and homeowners to understand their experiences and challenges with traditional door lock
                      systems. These interviews helped us uncover key insights related to convenience, security, and
                      control over access.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Contextual inquiry:</strong> To observe users in their natural environments, we visited
                      Airbnb properties, offices, and homes to gain insights into their daily routines and interactions
                      with door locks. This approach allowed us to identify specific pain points related to
                      accessibility and key-sharing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Surveys:</strong> We sent surveys to a broader audience of potential users, including
                      homeowners, property managers, and individuals interested in smart home solutions. The survey
                      responses provided us with quantitative data on user preferences, expectations, and willingness to
                      adopt digital lock systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Competitive analysis:</strong> We conducted a thorough analysis of existing digital lock
                      solutions in the market, assessing their features, user experiences, and limitations. This helped
                      us identify gaps and opportunities to differentiate Griffwerk's digital solution.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Major insights</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>INCONVENIENCE:</strong> Users expressed frustration with traditional lock systems,
                    especially when they
                    forgot or lost their keys or had their hands full. This insight emphasised the importance of a
                    seamless and
                    effortless door-unlocking experience. <br>
                    <p><em>User quote: "I often struggle to find my keys when my hands are full of groceries. It would
                        be great to have
                        a more convenient way to unlock my door."</em></p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>LACK OF CONTROL:</strong> Users felt they had limited control over access to their homes
                    or businesses,
                    relying on physical keys or sharing them with others. They emphasised the need for a solution that
                    provided granular
                    control over access permissions.
                    <p><em>User quote: "I can't keep track of who has my spare key, and it makes me uncomfortable. I
                        want a system that
                        lets me grant temporary access to specific individuals."</em></p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>ACCESSIBILITY CONCERNS:</strong> Users with disabilities or mobility issues highlighted
                    the challenges
                    they faced in using traditional lock systems, such as manipulating keys or turning doorknobs. This
                    insight
                    emphasised the importance of an inclusive design approach.
                    <p><em>User quote: "As someone with arthritis, it's difficult for me to grip and turn keys. A lock
                        system that
                        doesn't require physical dexterity would be a game-changer for me."</em></p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>LIMITED FEATURES:</strong> Users expressed a desire for additional features beyond basic
                    door unlocking,
                    such as remote access control and activity tracking. This insight highlighted the opportunity to
                    provide advanced
                    functionality that goes beyond traditional lock systems.
                    <p><em>User quote: "It would be fantastic if I could use my phone to give temporary access to guests
                        and receive
                        notifications whenever someone unlocks the door."</em></p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Vision</h2>

                <p>Our solution to providing people with a great door unlocking experience is based on the following key
                  features:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>CONVENIENCE:</strong> Users can easily manage their access to their homes or businesses
                    through their smartphones or voice recognition technology, eliminating the need for physical keys
                    that can be lost or forgotten.</li>
                  <li><strong>SECURITY:</strong> Digital locks and keys can provide a higher level of security compared
                    to traditional locks and keys, as they can be programmed to only allow authorized access and provide
                    an audit trail of access activity.</li>
                  <li><strong>CUSTOMIZATION:</strong>Users can customize access permissions and settings for different
                    individuals, such as family members, employees, or service providers.</li>
                  <li><strong>REMOTE ACCESS:</strong>With a digital solution, users can remotely manage their access
                    permissions and settings, providing greater flexibility and control over who can access their
                    property. </li>
                  <li><strong>INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SMART HOME DEVICES:</strong> Digital locks and keys can be
                    integrated with other smart home devices, such as security cameras or alarms, to provide a
                    comprehensive and interconnected security system.</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                  <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Metrics and Outcome</h2>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The importance of putting users at the center of the design process became evident during the research phase.
                    Conducting in-depth interviews, contextual inquiries, and surveys allowed us to truly understand the pain points and
                    needs of our target audience. This user-centric approach helped us create a solution that directly addressed their
                    challenges and preferences.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The discovery of accessibility concerns raised my awareness of the importance of inclusive design. Users with disabilities or mobility issues face unique challenges when interacting with traditional lock systems. Integrating inclusive design principles into the solution enabled us to create a more accessible and inclusive product that catered to a broader range of users.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Launching the app globally and tracking user metrics provided valuable insights into the success and impact of our solution. Monitoring adoption, engagement, and retention rates allowed us to iterate and improve the app based on user feedback. This iterative process reinforced the importance of continuous improvement and staying responsive to user needs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Working closely with a diverse team of prototypers, UI designers, developers, and the marketing team enriched my understanding of the collaborative nature of product design. Collaboration across disciplines ensured a holistic approach to problem-solving, resulting in a well-rounded and cohesive product.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The project's outcomes highlighted the importance of delivering value to customers and driving business growth. The positive customer feedback, increased customer base, and revenue growth demonstrated the value proposition of Griffwerk's digital solution. This experience emphasised the need to balance user satisfaction with the business objectives to create a successful product.
