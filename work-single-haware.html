              <div>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Context</h2>
                <p>Digital Transformation has transformed the personal care sector, redefining the concept of health and
                  well-being.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Opportunity statement</h2>
              <p>The national healthcare system has traditionally been perceived as lacking in technological innovation,
                causing
                limited access to treatments for psychophysical well-being and a lengthy process for consulting with a
                doctor.
                By integrating cutting-edge technologies into healthcare, we have the opportunity to improve efficiency,
                offer more
                personalized treatments, and foster a collaborative doctor-patient relationship.</p>
              <p>To develop innovative solutions in the healthcare field, the Ania Foundation and H-Farm organized H-ack
                Health, a
                24-hour hackathon where 31 groups came together to develop innovative solutions in the healthcare field.
              </p>
              <div>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge was to create a more patient-centred healthcare system that:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    fosters a holistic approach to health,
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    empowers individuals to take control of their well-being, and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    provides easy access to a network of professionals (experiences) with relevant expertise.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Specifically, the team aimed to develop a platform that enables fast and easy access to the
                  professionals so that
                  the patients can easily find and receive the care they need.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">My role</h2>
                <p>I led the experience strategy and design of the solution, producing and presenting all major
                  deliverables to the stakeholders. I worked alongside 2 developers, 3 marketers, and a UI designer.</p>
                <p class="text-center mb-5"><img src="images/team_haware.png" alt="Image placeholder" class="img-fluid">
                </p>
              </div>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Discovery</h2>
              <p>With no pre-existing insights, the team started digging to understand the challenges of people in need
                of care. Although we didn't conduct primary interviews or surveys due to the time constraints of the
                24-hour hackathon, we leveraged existing research to understand the personal care sector and the current
                state of the healthcare system. Our approach included a market analysis, user insights from existing
                platforms, and discussions with healthcare experts. These provided valuable insights into personal care,
                psychophysical well-being, healthcare challenges, trends, and user needs..</p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Insights gained from our research:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Most people aren't aware that it is necessary to take care of the body as well to achieve well-being. If the body is healthy, the person is happy.</li>
                <li>People suffering from a mental disorder are ashamed to seek treatment because it is widespread the implementation of a social distance towards people with mental illnesses</li>
                <li>Many people don't know that physical activity is important because it relieves anxiety and stress, and thanks to the endorphins produced by the body it makes us feel happy and satisfied.</li>
                <li>The process of seeking healthcare through the national system in Italy is perceived as time-consuming.</li>
                <li>Most people don't know where to turn to ask for psychophysical help.</li>
              </ul>
              <div>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Persona: Emma, the health seeker</h2>
