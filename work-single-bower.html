              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Context</h2>
              <p>Bower is a product company with a mission to make recycling gratifying and effortless, striving to
                create
                a waste-free world. After the launch in the UK market, I was entrusted with the responsibility of owning
                and optimizing the Bower app for this region.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Problem statement</h2>
              <p>The Bower app's activation rate in the UK market was significantly below expectations, indicating a
                clear
                problem in engaging users and driving adoption. After conducting extensive field research, it became
                apparent
                that the app's functionality did not align effectively with the recycling practices and preferences of
                UK users.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Challenge</h2>
              <p>To address these challenges, there was a need to redesign the app experience, creating a personalized
                and
                intuitive interface that seamlessly integrated with users' recycling habits and provided compelling
                incentives
                for sustained engagement.</p>
              <p>The goal was to increase the activation rate, enhance user satisfaction, and ultimately drive positive
                behavioral
                changes towards recycling through the Bower app.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">My role</h2>
              <p>Since November 2022, I have been leading the design of the Bower app for the UK market, focusing on
                driving the evolution of the product and addressing user pain points related to the scan and recycling
                experience.</p>
              <p><strong>INSIGHTS & IDEATION</strong> <br> I worked with a UX researcher and product manager to
                understand how UK users recycle, what motivates them, and the issues they face. We used these insights
                to bridge the gap between user needs and the app's design.</p>
              <p><strong>EXPERIENCE STRATEGY & VISION</strong> <br>To effectively communicate our vision, design
                principles, and content strategy, I developed rapid prototypes. Essential in sharing and advocating
                ideas, aligning stakeholders, and facilitating decision-making.</p>
              <p><strong>PLANNING & SCOPE DEFINITION</strong> <br>Working closely with the product manager, I played a
                crucial role in defining the product. I advocated for user goals while balancing business objectives,
                and collaborated to prioritize and negotiate features accordingly.</p>
              <p><strong>DESIGN EXECUTION & VALIDATION</strong> <br>I executed the design process, encompassing journey
                mapping, wireframing, prototyping, and creating design specs.</p>
              <p><strong>LEADERSHIP</strong> <br>Throughout the project lifecycle, I employed leadership skills to
                present and gain buy-in for my work from executives, senior stakeholders, and various other team
                members.</p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Discovery</h2>
              <p>We conducted field research, visiting recycling centers, and observing users' recycling behaviors in
                real-world contexts. This provided valuable insights into the challenges and pain points users face
                during the recycling process.</p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Major insights</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>LACK OF PERCEIVED VALUE:</strong> Users did not fully understand how the Bower app could
                  help them with recycling nor how it could add value to their daily lives. This lack of perceived value
                  led to users losing interest and dropping off.</li>
                <li><strong>MISLEADING ONBOARDING:</strong> The onboarding process of the app resulted in misleading,
                  overly complicated, or time-consuming, deterring users from fully engaging with the app. Users lost
                  patience or didn't understand it and found it difficult to navigate through the initial setup, leading
                  them to abandon the app.</li>
                <li><strong>MISMATCH EXPECTATIONS:</strong> Users had certain expectations from the app based on its
                  marketing and initial description such as more money incentives and recycling instructions. The app
                  failed to meet these expectations and didn't align with users' specific needs and mental models.</li>
                <li><strong>POOR USER EXPERIENCE:</strong> Users encountered usability issues, a confusing interface,
                  and technical glitches within the app, resulting in frustration and dissatisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>CAHLLENGES IN ADDING PRIVATE BINS:</strong> Users faced challenges when attempting to add
                  their private bins within the app. Some users were unaware that this feature even existed. This made
                  it
                  impossible for them to recycle with the app through the kerbside collection.</li>
                <li><strong>EDUCATION AND CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS:</strong> The research emphasized the opportunity to
                  educate users about recycling and provide clear instructions.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Solution & Design approach</h2>
              <p>The goal was to redesign the app focusing on a personalized experience that aligned with UK users'
                recycling habits. To address the challenges identified we implemented the following solutions:</p>
              <div>
                <div>
                  <p><img src="images/Pre-registration onboarding.png" alt="Pre-registration onboarding" class="img-fluid"></p><br>
                  <p><strong>VALUE-DRIVEN MESSAGING AND CONTENT STRATEGY:</strong> To enhance the perceived value of the
                    Bower app, we
                    revamped the
                    messaging and content throughout the user journey. Clear and concise explanations were provided to
                    communicate how
                    the app could assist users in their recycling efforts, including benefits such as environmental
                    impact
                    reduction,
                    rewards, and community engagement.</p>
                </div><br>
                <div>
                  <p><img src="images/add bins.png" alt="Post-registration onboarding" class="img-fluid"></p><br>
                  <p><strong>STREAMLINED ONBOARDING PROCESS:</strong> The onboarding process was simplified and made
                    more
                    intuitive to
                    ensure a smooth
                    initial setup experience. We reduced the number of steps required and provided contextual guidance
                    to
                    help users
                    understand the purpose and functionality of each feature. Clear instructions and interactive
                    elements
                    were
                    implemented to assist users in navigating the app effectively from the start.</p>
                  <p><strong>ALIGNMENT WITH USER EXPECTATIONS:</strong> To bridge the gap between users' expectations
                    and the app's functionality, we conducted a thorough analysis of user feedback and market research.
                    Based on these insights, we fine-tuned the app's features, incorporating a better reward system,
                    personal statistics,
                    recycling instructions, and educational content. This alignment with users' specific needs and
                    mental
                    models
                    improved overall satisfaction and engagement.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>SIMPLIFIED PROCESS FOR ADDING PRIVATE BINS:</strong> Recognizing the challenges users
                    faced
                    when adding
                    private bins, we
                    introduced a prominent and easily accessible feature within the app. Clear instructions and visual
                    cues were
                    provided to guide users through the process, ensuring they could seamlessly connect their private
                    bins
                    to the app
                    and participate in the kerbside collection.</p>
                  <p><strong>EDUCATION AND CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS:</strong> To empower users with recycling knowledge, we
                    integrated
                    educational content and
                    clear instructions within the app. This included recycling guidelines, tips for proper waste
                    disposal,
                    and
                    information on local recycling centers. By providing users with the necessary information, we aimed
                    to
                    encourage
                    proper recycling practices and facilitate their engagement with the app.</p>
                  <p><strong>IMPROVED USER EXPERIENCE AND INTERFACE DESIGN:</strong> The interface was redesigned to be
                    more intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly. Additionally, technical issues were resolved
                    to
                    ensure a seamless user experience.

                <p><strong>IMPORTANCE OF USER RESEARCH</strong> <br> The project reinforced the importance of user
                  research in informing design decisions. Conducting in-depth interviews and usability tests provided
                  valuable insights into users' needs, expectations, and pain points. It highlighted the significance
                  of understanding user motivations and aligning the app's features with their preferences to drive
                  engagement.</p>
                <p><strong>PERCEIVED VALUE</strong> <br>Effectively communicating the value proposition and benefits of
                  the app to users is crucial. The project taught me the importance of clearly articulating how the
                  Bower
                  app can help users with their recycling efforts and add value to their daily lives. It's essential to
                  ensure
                  that users understand the app's purpose and how it aligns with their goals.</p>
                <p><strong>ITERATIVE DESIGN PROCESS</strong> <br>Continuously testing and refining design prototypes
                  based
                  on user feedback improved and ensured that the final design decisions were user-centered. It
                  highlighted
                  the significance of being open to feedback and adapting designs based on user needs and preferences.
                </p>
                <p><strong>BALANCING USER NEEDS AND BUSINESS OBJECTIVES</strong> <br>This project highlighted the need
                  to
                  balance user needs and business objectives. While it's important to prioritize user goals and
                  satisfaction,
                  it's equally essential to consider the viability and feasibility of implementing certain features or
                  incentives within the app. Collaborating closely with the product manager and stakeholders helped me
                  navigate
                  this balance effectively.</p>
                <p><strong>COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP</strong> <br>Leading the design of the Bower app for the UK market
                  required
                  strong leadership skills. I learned the importance of effectively communicating design ideas, aligning
                  stakeholders,
                  and gaining buy-in for design decisions. Collaborating with executives, senior stakeholders, and team
                  members
