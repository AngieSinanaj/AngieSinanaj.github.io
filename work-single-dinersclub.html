              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Context</h2>
              <p>Diners Club is a renowned global credit card company. With the rapid growth of mobile usage and the
                increasing popularity of mobile banking, Diners Club realized the need to revamp its existing mobile app
                to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience. The goal was to improve customer satisfaction and
                increase engagement.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Problem statement</h2>
              <p>The existing Diners Club mobile app lacked an intuitive and user-friendly interface, resulting in poor
                user engagement and subpar user experience. Users found it difficult to navigate through the app, access
                their account information, and perform transactions efficiently. This led to frustration and a decline
                in overall customer satisfaction.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Challenge</h2>
              <p>The primary challenge was to redesign the Diners Club app to provide a modern and intuitive user
                experience while maintaining the brand's identity. The app needed to cater to a wide range of user
                demographics, including both tech-savvy and less tech-savvy customers. Additionally, it was crucial to
                address security concerns and ensure that sensitive financial information remained protected.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">My role</h2>
              <p>During the Diners Club app redesign, I was responsible for the experience strategy and design of the
                iOS app. From November 2018 to March 2019, I took charge of the UX work, producing all major
                deliverables and presenting them to the client. Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with a UX
                Architect who specialised in designing the Android app, ensuring effective teamwork and coordination.
              </p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">The approach</h2>
              <p>To tackle the challenge at hand, I followed a user-centred design approach, which involved conducting
                user research, gathering insights, and iteratively designing and testing prototypes.</p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Discovery</h2>
              <p>Through user interviews, surveys, and usability tests I gained a deep understanding of the pain points
                and expectations of Diners Club app users. After analysing the data, I identified common patterns in
                order to compile a list of key issues that needed addressing.</p>
              <div>
                <p><strong>RESEARCH PROCESS</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Recruitment:</strong> We aimed for a diverse sample of Diners Club app users to ensure we
                    captured
                    insights from various demographics. Our sample consisted of 50 participants, ranging from tech-savvy
                    individuals
                    to less tech-savvy users. To recruit participants, we used a mix of methods, including in-app
                    surveys and online
                    recruitment platforms.

              <div>
                <p><strong>RESEARCH METHOD</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>User interviews:</strong> We conducted semi-structured interviews, allowing for open-ended
                    discussions and
                    follow-up questions to gain a deeper understanding of users experiences, pain points, and
                    expectations related to
                    the Diners Club app.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Surveys:</strong> We designed and sent online surveys to gather quantitative data on user
                    preferences,
                    satisfaction levels, and specific pain points. The surveys included Likert scale questions,
                    multiple-choice
                    questions, and open-ended questions for participants to provide detailed feedback.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Usability tests:</strong> To evaluate the usability of the existing app, we conducted
                    usability tests with
                    representative tasks. Participants were observed while performing tasks related to account
                    management,
                    transactions,
                    and accessing specific features. This allowed us to identify specific pain points and areas of
                    improvement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Competitive analysis:</strong> We conducted a competitive analysis to gain insights into
                    industry best
                    practices and benchmark the Diners Club app against other mobile banking and credit card apps. This
                    helped us
                    identify areas where the app fell short and opportunities for improvement.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The data collected from interviews, surveys, and usability tests were analysed using qualitative and
                    quantitative analysis techniques. Qualitative data from interviews and open-ended survey responses
                    were coded and categorised to identify common themes and patterns. Quantitative data from surveys
                    were analysed using statistical methods to identify trends and calculate metrics such as
                    satisfaction scores.

                  <li>
                    Users struggled to find specific features and navigate through different sections of the app. The
                    existing navigation structure was complex and lacked clear visual cues, leading to frustration. Users
                    expected a more intuitive and easily accessible navigation system. </li>
                  <li>

                  <p>
                    I had the opportunity to learn and grow. This experience gave me valuable insights and lessons that have shaped my understanding of user-centered design and mobile app development.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>USER RESEARCH IS IMPORTANCE</strong> <br> Conducting thorough user research was fundamental in understanding the pain points and expectations of Diners Club app users. The insights gathered, played a crucial role in driving the redesign decisions and ensuring a user-centered approach.</p>
                  <p><strong>BRAND IDENTITY</strong> <br> Redesigning the app while maintaining the brand's identity was a delicate balance. I learned the importance of finding creative solutions that not only improved the user experience but also stayed true to the brand's aesthetics and values. Iterative design and feedback loops helped achieve this balance effectively.</p>
                  <p><strong>COLLABORATION AND TEAMWORK</strong> <br> Collaborating closely with a UX Architect specialized in Android app design taught me the importance of teamwork and effective communication. Working together allowed us to leverage our individual strengths and ensure consistency across platforms while tailoring the user experience to the specific requirements of each operating system.</p>
                  <p><strong>ITERATIVE DESIGN AND USER TESTING</strong> <br> The iterative design process, coupled with user testing, proved to be crucial in refining the app's user experience. Testing prototypes with real users and incorporating their feedback helped identify pain points, uncover usability issues, and make informed design decisions to improve the app's overall usability.</p>
                  <p><strong>PERSONALIZATION</strong> <br> Understanding the importance of personalization in today's digital landscape was a key takeaway. Offering tailored recommendations, personalized offers, and customizable features not only improved the user experience but also fostered a sense of ownership and satisfaction among users.</p>
                  <p><strong>CONTINUOUS IMPROVMENT</strong> <br> The launch of the redesigned app was just the beginning. I learned the importance of collecting user feedback, analyzing app analytics, and continuously iterating on the design to address evolving user needs and preferences. Embracing a mindset of continuous improvement allows the app to stay relevant and provide an exceptional user experience in a rapidly changing technological landscape.</p>
